# `aaa-react-scripts-ts` [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/aaa-react-scripts-ts.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/aaa-react-scripts-ts)

This project is a fork of [create-react-app-typescript](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript) further tailored to the opinionated needs of [@majodev](https://github.com/majodev) and [all about apps](https://allaboutapps.at).

## Features
* Fully configured [Visual Studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) environment (debugging, recommended extensions, tasks).   
* Allows to extend webpack configuration through a `webpack.js` inside the project without the need to eject.   

See the updated [README](packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) for more information on the included dependencies.

See [Forking react-scripts](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/682) for information of the forking process.

Create React apps (with Typescript) with no build configuration.

_Do you know react and want to try out typescript? Or do you know typescript and want to try out react?_ Get all the benefits from `create-react-app` but you use typescript! üöÄ

## tl;dr

```sh
npm install -g create-react-app

create-react-app my-app --scripts-version=aaa-react-scripts-ts
cd my-app/
npm start
```

No configuration or complicated folder structures, just the files you need to build your app.<br>
Once the installation is done, you can run some commands inside the project folder:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.<br>
By default, runs tests related to files changes since the last commit.

[Read more about testing.](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#running-tests)

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## How to Update to New Versions?

Please refer to the [User Guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#updating-to-new-releases) for this and other information.

## Philosophy

* **One Dependency:** There is just one build dependency. It uses Webpack, Babel, ESLint, and other amazing projects, but provides a cohesive curated experience on top of them.

* **Convention over Configuration:** You don't need to configure anything by default. Reasonably good configuration of both development and production builds is handled for you so you can focus on writing code.

* **No Lock-In:** You can ‚Äúeject‚Äù to a custom setup at any time. Run a single command, and all the configuration and build dependencies will be moved directly into your project, so you can pick up right where you left off.

## Why Use This?

**If you‚Äôre getting started** with React, use `create-react-app` to automate the build of your app. There is no configuration file, and `react-scripts` is the only extra build dependency in your `package.json`. Your environment will have everything you need to build a modern React app:

* React, JSX, ES6, and Flow syntax support.
* Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
* A dev server that lints for common errors.
* Import CSS and image files directly from JavaScript.
* Autoprefixed CSS, so you don‚Äôt need `-webkit` or other prefixes.
* A `build` script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with sourcemaps.

**The feature set is intentionally limited**. It doesn‚Äôt support advanced features such as server rendering or CSS modules. The tool is also **non-configurable** because it is hard to provide a cohesive experience and easy updates across a set of tools when the user can tweak anything.

**You don‚Äôt have to use this.** Historically it has been easy to [gradually adopt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BF58ZJ1ZQxY) React. However many people create new single-page React apps from scratch every day. We‚Äôve heard [loud](https://medium.com/@ericclemmons/javascript-fatigue-48d4011b6fc4) and [clear](https://twitter.com/thomasfuchs/status/708675139253174273) that this process can be error-prone and tedious, especially if this is your first JavaScript build stack. This project is an attempt to figure out a good way to start developing React apps.

### Converting to a Custom Setup

**If you‚Äôre a power user** and you aren‚Äôt happy with the default configuration, you can ‚Äúeject‚Äù from the tool and use it as a boilerplate generator.

Running `npm run eject` copies all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. Commands like `npm start` and `npm run build` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you‚Äôre on your own.

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

## Limitations

Some features are currently **not supported**:

* Server rendering.
* Some experimental syntax extensions (e.g. decorators).
* CSS Modules.
* Importing LESS or Sass directly ([but you still can use them](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-a-css-preprocessor-sass-less-etc)).
* Hot reloading of components.

Some of them might get added in the future if they are stable, are useful to majority of React apps, don‚Äôt conflict with existing tools, and don‚Äôt introduce additional configuration.

## What‚Äôs Inside?

The tools used by Create React App are subject to change.
Currently it is a thin layer on top of many amazing community projects, such as:

* [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) with [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server), [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin) and [style-loader](https://github.com/webpack/style-loader)
* [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) with ES6 and extensions used by Facebook (JSX, [object spread](https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread/commits/master), [class properties](https://github.com/jeffmo/es-class-public-fields))
* [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
* [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)
* [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest)
* and others.

All of them are transitive dependencies of the provided npm package.

### Code highlighting on error
When you run `npm run build` the terminal will output the error, including the highlighted sourecode (like babel)!
